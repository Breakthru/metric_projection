This MATLAB code depends on the CVX: Matlab Software for
Disciplined Convex Programming (http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvx/)
and the SeDuMi solver (http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/)

Please download and install CVX before using this software.
You can run the "demo" and "demo_articulated" script to execute the
software on sample data and see the resutls.
